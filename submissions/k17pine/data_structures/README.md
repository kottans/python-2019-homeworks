# Stack and linked list 

Here is client and server for exchanging information via web.

## Getting Started

Some commands, that you could use on the client side:
push arg - push something into stack
pop - pop last arg from stack
insert arg arg2* arg3* - insert element to the linked list. arg2 could be 'before' or 'after', and arg3 show point from this insertion
remove arg - remove one argument from list
show all - show all linked list
exit - exit from client 
* - optional arguments
